# Hi, my name is Hady.

I've been a passionate software engineer and a tech leader for nearly two decades, 18 years of experience to be exact if you're the
counting type.

Programming has been a hobby of mine since I was a kid hanging around IRC channels on freenode, hacking my school computers, and
botting ICQ. Next thing I know, I'm doing it professionally... As fate would have it, it isn't without a sense of irony. After nearly two decades of professional work I'm at a stage now where I crave this _hobby_ feeling. Hacking on things with no purpose other than for the heck of it.

In my day to day work, my mission on any project I work on, on any team I lead and mentor, and in any organization I manage, 
my mission is to raise the quality bar. I'm usually the guy you copy from, setting quasi-standards org-wide. But tooting my own horn aside,
the goal is simple. I want to take my positive net-multiplier do-better attitude I successfully carry in closed, proprietary work environments and do my part
giving back publicly.

So, not too long ago, I got lucky enough to acquire the domain name [hady.ai](https://hady.ai), and decided to rebrand 
my online identity from [l0gicpath](https://github.com/l0gicpath) to this. It's the start of something exciting and I hope you find my work here useful to you and your
career as an engineer.
