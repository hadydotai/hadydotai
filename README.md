# Hi, my name is Hady.

I've been a passionate software engineer and a tech leader for nearly two decades, 18 years of experience to be exact if you're the
counting type.

Programming has been a hobby of mine since I was a kid hanging around IRC channels on freenode, hacking my school computers, and
botting ICQ. Next thing I know, I'm doing it professionally... As fate would have it, it isn't without a sense of irony. After nearly two decades of professional work I'm at a stage now where I crave this _hobby_ feeling. Hacking on things with no purpose other than for the heck of it.

In my day to day work, my mission on any project I work on, on any team I lead and mentor, and in any organization I manage, 
my mission is to raise the quality bar. I'm usually the guy you copy from, setting quasi-standards org-wide. But tooting my own horn aside,
the goal is simple. I want to take my positive net-multiplier do-better attitude I successfully carry in closed, proprietary work environments and do my part
giving back publicly.

So, not too long ago, I got lucky enough to acquire the domain name [hady.ai](https://hady.ai), and decided to rebrand 
my online identity from [l0gicpath](https://github.com/l0gicpath) to this. It's the start of something exciting and I hope you find my work here useful to you and your
career as an engineer.

# Why AI?

I'm every bit as curious about machine learning as the person next to you, is why... Because to me it represents a point 
in time that marks an infraction in our reality, our norms are shifting, and our experiences are being reimagined.

I grew up in the 90s, wrote my first programs in '98. The world today is a far cry from what it was back then, I missed the
boat on all the innovation of the late 60s and 70s. Today, we're seeing the same level of innovation but on a different scale. It's
every bit as disruptive and exciting as it was back then but x 30. I have no intention on missing the boat for this one. I suggest you don't either.

Unless your question is about [hady.ai](https://hady.ai)? Well obviously because my name makes one hell of a domain name, it's fucking cool! Excuse my colorfulness.

# Technologies I Work With

I'm a polyglot engineer, if that doesn't register a certain image in your head then perhaps enjoy the work you see here on
my Github and don't ask me questions like "Do you know Javascript?" because then I'll ask you back "Do you know how to build Unikernels in OCaml?" or "When was the last time you wrote a Forth VM in C?".

Yes, I'm _intimately_ familiar with Javascript I work with it, and it's cooler cousine Typescript, there's also their distant relative ReasonML and their
bastard child Coffeescript, you remember that one? No? Well, anyway, I've also worked with dozen more languages including Go, Rust, Ruby, C, and all
of which I've shipped in production. And yes, I have actually built Unikernels in OCaml, wrote Pascal for the military, and 
built a proprietary programming language that's used in production by my current employer shipping 250K SLOC in it.

I write software for a living. I know things okay, stop asking silly questions. This reminds of a story

> A man met a Carpenter one time, paused for a second and then proceeded enthusiastically to ask if they knew how to use a 
> _hammer_. The carpenter shocked at the absurdity of the question, exclaimed "A _hammer_?! Well of course - I'm a carpenter, he said".
> The man, shook his head in awww and blurted "What type?!"
> The carpenter in disblief, looked dead serious at the man and said "The one with a metal head, mounted at right angles at the end of a wooden handle... Yeah, that one."

Perhaps asking about the most recent technologies (last 6 month) I've shipping to production is more fitting?
- React, Next.js
- Go, Rust, Typescript, Javascript, and [Janet](https://janet-lang.org/)
- Postgres and Clickhouse
